# Threads

Initialization: The ManagedThread class takes an optional target function that it will execute repeatedly until stopped. It initializes control flags for stopping (\_stop_event) and pausing (\_pause_event).

Control Methods: The start, stop, pause, and resume methods control the thread's lifecycle. start initiates the thread, stop halts it permanently, pause temporarily suspends execution, and resume restarts execution after a pause.

Execution Flow Control: The internal method \_run_with_control checks the stop and pause events to manage the execution flow accordingly. When paused, the thread sleeps in a low-CPU-usage wait state until resume is called.

Thread Safety and Management: The implementation uses threading events (Event) for thread-safe signaling between control methods and the thread's running loop.

This expanded Thread class offers a more controlled and manageable way of handling threads in Python, mimicking functionalities that are often required in more sophisticated threading scenarios, such as in operating systems or complex applications.

# Process

Process Management: The ManagedProcess class encapsulates a simulated process, using Python's multiprocessing.Process for actual process creation and management. Each ManagedProcess can have multiple ManagedThread instances, simulating threads within the process.

Starting and Stopping: The start method initiates the process and its threads. The stop method signals the process to terminate and stops all its threads.

Thread Management: add_thread allows adding new threads to the process. If the process is already running, it starts the thread immediately.

Simulating Process Work: The \_process_target method simulates process work and periodically checks if a stop event has been set, allowing for clean termination.

Inter-Process and Thread Communication: While this example focuses on process and thread management, extending it to include IPC mechanisms would involve integrating shared memory or message queues for communication between processes and threads, as outlined in the IPC section.

This expanded class provides a foundational framework for simulating process and thread management in a Python-based operating system simulation. Further enhancements could include more detailed process and thread metrics, improved error handling, and the integration of IPC mechanisms for comprehensive simulation.

# Create Process

Dynamic Process and Thread Creation: This method dynamically creates a specified number of ManagedProcess instances, each with a set number of threads. Each thread is assigned a thread_target function, which represents the workload to be executed in parallel.

Simulated Workload: The example_thread_target function simulates a simple workload for threads. In a real-world scenario, this could be any function, such as processing data, performing calculations, or handling I/O operations.

Control Flow: After starting all processes and their threads, the script waits for user input to proceed with stopping them. This pause allows us to observe the simulation running and demonstrates a simple way to manage process lifecycles dynamically.

Termination: Upon receiving input, the script cleanly stops all processes and their associated threads, showcasing graceful shutdown and resource cleanup.

This expanded method, combined with the previously defined ManagedProcess and ManagedThread classes, offers a foundational simulation of an operating system's process and thread management capabilities. It highlights the hierarchical structure of processes containing threads and the dynamic nature of starting and stopping these computing resources.
